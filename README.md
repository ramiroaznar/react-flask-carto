virtualenv venv; source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

These steps are explained in more detail below.

## Prerequisites

You'll need some package managers.

- `npm`
- `pip`

## Running the app

If you're using a virtualenv, activate it.

source venv/bin/activate
```

Then run the Flask app:

```
python app.py
```

In a separated console tab:

```
npm start
```
